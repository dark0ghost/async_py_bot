**IMPORTANT:** This package will be deprecated after
`contextvars asyncio backport`_ is fixed. Before then, this library
experimentally provides the missing asyncio support for the
``contextvars`` backport library. Please read more in Python 3.7 `contextvars
documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html>`_.


Compatibility
-------------

In Python 3.7 this package *is* 100% ``contextvars``.

In Python 3.5 and 3.6, this package added asyncio support to the PEP-567
backport package also named ``contextvars``, in a very different way than
Python 3.7 ``contextvars`` implementation:

1. ``call_soon()`` and family methods.

Python 3.7 added keyword argument ``context`` to ``call_soon()`` and its family
methods. By default those methods will copy (inherit) the current context and
run the given method in that context. But ``aiocontextvars`` won't touch the
loop, so in order to achieve the same effect, you'll need to::

    loop.call_soon(copy_context().run, my_meth)

2. Task local.

Python 3.7 used above keyword argument ``context`` in ``Task`` to make sure
that each step of a coroutine is ran in the same context inherited at the time
its driving task was created. Meanwhile, ``aiocontextvars`` uses
``Task.current_task()`` to achieve similar effect: it hacks asyncio and
attaches a copied context to the task on its creation, and replaces thread
local with current task instance to share the context. This behaves identically
to Python 3.7 in most times. What you need to do is to import
``aiocontextvars`` before creating loops.

3. Custom tasks and loops.

Because above hack is done by replacing ``asyncio.get_event_loop`` and
``loop.create_task``, therefore tasks and loops created by custom/private API
won't behave correctly as expected, e.g. ``uvloop.new_event_loop()`` or
``asyncio.Task()``. Also, event loops created before importing
``aiocontextvars`` are not patched either. So over all, you should import
``aiocontextvars`` at the beginning before creating event loops, and always use
``asyncio.*`` to operate loops/policies, and public asyncio API to create
tasks.

=======
History
=======

0.2.1 (2018-10-24)
------------------

* Changed to single module layout.
* Updated README.

0.2.0 (2018-09-09)
------------------

**This is a breaking change.** Most implementation is replaced with
``contextvars``. In Python 3.5 and 3.6, ``aiocontextvars`` depends on
``contextvars`` the PEP-567 backport in PyPI, and patches it to partially
support asyncio; in Python 3.7 ``aiocontextvars`` is only a delegate to the
built-in ``contextvars`` library.

* Modified ``ContextVar.set()`` to return a token.
* Added ``ContextVar.reset(token)``.
* Removed ``ContextVar.delete()``.
* Removed ``enable_inherit()`` and ``disable_inherit()``, inherit is always enabled.
* Added ``copy_context()`` and ``Context.run()``.
* Removed ``Context.current()`` and ``Context.inherited``.
* Fixed issue that ``set_event_loop(None)`` fails (contributed by J.J. Jackson in #10 #11)

0.1.2 (2018-04-04)
------------------

* Supported Python 3.5.

0.1.1 (2017-12-03)
------------------

* Fixed setup.py

0.1.0 (2017-12-03)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
